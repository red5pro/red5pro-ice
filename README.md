# red5pro-ice

ICE library for the Red5 Pro Server. This library was originally derived from ice4j with a fork being heavily modified by Red5. The I/O layer and much of the logic has been reimagined to fulfill our needs and now lives here as a separate and distinct project.

## Features

I/O via [Mina](https://mina.apache.org/)
mDNS support via [jmdns](https://github.com/jmdns/jmdns)
