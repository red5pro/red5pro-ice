 * Ever CheckList is associated with a state, which captures the state of ICE checks for that media stream. There are three states:
 * <br>
 * Running:  In this state, ICE checks are still in progress for this media stream.
 * <br>
 * Completed:  In this state, ICE checks have produced nominated pairs for each component of the media stream.  Consequently, ICE has succeeded and
 * media can be sent.
 * <br>
 * Failed:  In this state, the ICE checks have not completed successfully for this media stream.
 * <br>
 * When a check list is first constructed as the consequence of an offer/answer exchange, it is placed in the Running state.
