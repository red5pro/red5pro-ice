/**
 * RFC 5245 mentions that ICE processing across all media streams also has a
 * state associated with it. This state is equal to Running while ICE
 * processing is under way. The state is Completed when ICE processing is
 * complete and Failed if it failed without success. For convenience reasons
 * we are also adding two extra states. The first one is the Waiting
 * state that reflects the state of an {@link Agent} before it starts
 * processing. This is also an {@link Agent }'s default state. The second one
 * is the "Terminated" state. RFC 5245 says that once ICE processing
 * has reached the Completed state for all peers for media streams using
 * those candidates, the agent SHOULD wait an additional three seconds,
 * and then it MAY cease responding to checks or generating triggered
 * checks on that candidate.  It MAY free the candidate at that time.
 * which reflects the state where an Agent does not need to handle incoming
 * checks any more and is ready for garbage collection. This is the state we
 * refer to with "Terminated".
