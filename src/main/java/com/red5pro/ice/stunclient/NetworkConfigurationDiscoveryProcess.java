/**
 * <p>
 * This class implements the STUN Discovery Process as described by section 10.1 of rfc 3489.
 * </p><p>
 * The flow makes use of three tests.  In test I, the client sends a STUN Binding Request to a server, without any flags set in the
 * CHANGE-REQUEST attribute, and without the RESPONSE-ADDRESS attribute. This causes the server to send the response back to the address and
 * port that the request came from.  In test II, the client sends a Binding Request with both the "change IP" and "change port" flags
 * from the CHANGE-REQUEST attribute set.  In test III, the client sends a Binding Request with only the "change port" flag set.
 * </p><p>
 * The client begins by initiating test I.  If this test yields no response, the client knows right away that it is not capable of UDP
 * connectivity.  If the test produces a response, the client examines the MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute.  If this address and port are the same
 * as the local IP address and port of the socket used to send the request, the client knows that it is not natted.  It executes test II.
 * </p><p>
 * If a response is received, the client knows that it has open access to the Internet (or, at least, its behind a firewall that behaves
 * like a full-cone NAT, but without the translation).  If no response is received, the client knows its behind a symmetric UDP firewall.
 * </p><p>
 * In the event that the IP address and port of the socket did not match the MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute in the response to test I, the client
 * knows that it is behind a NAT.  It performs test II.  If a response is received, the client knows that it is behind a full-cone NAT.  If
 * no response is received, it performs test I again, but this time, does so to the address and port from the CHANGED-ADDRESS attribute
 * from the response to test I.  If the IP address and port returned in the MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute are not the same as the ones from the
 * first test I, the client knows its behind a symmetric NAT.  If the address and port are the same, the client is either behind a
 * restricted or port restricted NAT.  To make a determination about which one it is behind, the client initiates test III.  If a response
 * is received, its behind a restricted NAT, and if no response is received, its behind a port restricted NAT.
 * </p><p>
 * This procedure yields substantial information about the operating condition of the client application.  In the event of multiple NATs
 * between the client and the Internet, the type that is discovered will be the type of the most restrictive NAT between the client and the
 * Internet.  The types of NAT, in order of restrictiveness, from most to least, are symmetric, port restricted cone, restricted cone, and
 * full cone.
 * </p><p>
 * Typically, a client will re-do this discovery process periodically to detect changes, or look for inconsistent results.  It is important to
 * note that when the discovery process is redone, it should not generally be done from the same local address and port used in the
 * previous discovery process.  If the same local address and port are reused, bindings from the previous test may still be in existence,
 * and these will invalidate the results of the test.  Using a different local address and port for subsequent tests resolves this problem.
 * An alternative is to wait sufficiently long to be confident that the old bindings have expired (half an hour should more than suffice).
 * </p>
