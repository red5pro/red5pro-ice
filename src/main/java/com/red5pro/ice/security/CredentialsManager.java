 * The CredentialsManager allows an application to handle verification

 * is to allow use in both applications that would handle large numbers of
 * possible users (such as STUN/TURN servers) or others that would only work
 * with a few, like for example an ICE implementation.
 *
 * TODO: just throwing a user name at the manager and expecting it to find
 * an authority that knows about it may lead to ambiguities so we may need
 * to add other parameters in here that would allow us to better select an
 * authority.
